# Machine learning

This project is a representation of the waking work that we had to carry out over the year, from the period from September 1, 2017 to April 2018 about machine learning.

We had to cut a list of items and display them as a timeline.

Each sphere is represented by a particle shape, just click on one of them to get the article.

It is also possible to access the bibliography / sitography and the explanation of the concept of machine learning.

I focused on [Three](https://threejs.org/) and WebGL at the technical level.
